"""Print `<module> <package>...` for every module declaring packages for one family.

Read by the `packages` job, which dry-runs each line in a container of that
family. A name that does not resolve is then reported against the module that
wrote it rather than against a union of every list, which is the whole reason
the lines are kept apart. Run from the library root.

    packages.py <family>
    packages.py <family> --repos

`--repos` prints instead every `repo` file this family would source, which the
job runs before it resolves anything: a package out of a third-party archive
cannot be resolved on a base that has never heard of it, and skipping those
modules would leave the widenings most likely to break as the ones nothing
measures. A module declaring no packages is listed too -- one that only turns
a component on is exactly the module the others depend on.

Only modules whose `supports` names the family are read, so the set is the same
one the `collection` leg of that family imports.
