# Debian's own archive one suite further on, so there is no key to add:
# `debian-archive-keyring` already carries sid's, and the same two keys sign
# forky and sid -- checked 2026-09-07.
#
# An unpinned `sid` entry does not add one package, it offers apt a newer
# everything, and the next `apt upgrade` takes the machine to unstable. So the
# suite goes in at priority 1 -- present, never preferred -- and chromium's
# own binary packages are the only ones lifted back above forky's.
