# `ubuntu:*` ships `/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/excludes`, which `path-exclude`s every
# man page, every `/usr/share/doc` file but `copyright` and `changelog`, and the
# locale catalogues. A `path-exclude` applies at *unpack* time and is inherited,
# permanent and silent: deleting the file gives documentation back to packages
# installed after it and restores nothing already on disk. So the reinstall is
# the other half, and every published Ubuntu bootc base skips it. It costs 27s
# and 39 MB.
#
# Here rather than in `deb/bootc-base` because this is the module every deb
# build's closure puts first — it has to run before the first install of any
# module, and `provides "build-environment"` is what guarantees that. `debian:*`
# ships no such file and the guard is what makes this one module for both.
