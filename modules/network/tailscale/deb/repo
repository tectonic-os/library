# Tailscale publishes one pool under a suite per distribution release, and the
# `debian` and `ubuntu` trees differ only in that name -- the forky and
# resolute indices are byte identical, checked 2026-09-07. So `$ID` and
# `$VERSION_CODENAME` are all that separates the two families here, which is
# why this is one `deb/repo` rather than a `debian/` and an `ubuntu/` one.
