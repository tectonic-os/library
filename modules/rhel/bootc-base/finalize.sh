# /root, /srv and /mnt are symlinks into /var, /ostree points into /sysroot,
# and /usr/local stays a real directory, which is where EL differs from the deb
# base. /opt is not here: the tool's own finalize relocates it and restores the
# base's directory afterwards.
# /boot is emptied rather than kept: the kernel package leaves its vmlinuz,
# config, System.map and a second initramfs there, and `bootc install`
# populates the real one. `centos-bootc:stream10` ships an empty /boot and
# `bootc container lint` warns about anything else.
